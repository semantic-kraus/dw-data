    rdfs:comment "The digital edition of 'Dritte Walpurgisnacht' consists of one TEI-XML file containing the transcription of the text as well as annotations referencing entries in an index file containing 400 person and 1,900 bibliographical entries. The RDF data represents the state of the project data in early 2022. It includes person mentions as well as intertextual relations, the latter connecting the 'Dritte Walpurgisnacht' to its intertexts as well as these with each other. While the digital edition differentiates between types of intertextual references – e.g., exemplary vs. specific –, the RDF data does currently not reflect these distinctions." ;
